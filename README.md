## Configuration

Edit `config.yaml` to customize:
- Data source and column names
- Model parameters (size, prediction_length, context_length)
- Test set size
- Output settings

## Moirai Model

Moirai is a foundation model for time series forecasting:
- Pre-trained on diverse time series
- Supports multiple forecast horizons
- Handles missing values and irregular frequencies
- Uses transformer architecture

## Caveats

- Requires data file with date and value columns.
- Model downloads pre-trained weights on first run (requires internet).
- GPU recommended for faster inference but not required.
- Prediction length should match test_size for proper evaluation.
